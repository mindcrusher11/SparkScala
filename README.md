Run Project Steps ðŸ‘Ž

Create Jar File from this project

```
sbt package
```
Run application 

```
sbt run
```
Configuration file can be set in application.conf file which can be passed as an argument to the jar or in src/main/resources folder.

e.g

```
spark {
masterurl = "local[*]"
appName = "omicsspark"
checkpointDir = "./checkpoint"
batchDuration = "15"
}

file {
writeformat = "com.databricks.spark.csv"
titlePrincipalPath = "/partition/sparkscalabgc/src/main/resources/imdbdata/title.principals.tsv.gz"
titleRatingsPath = "/partition/sparkscalabgc/src/main/resources/imdbdata/title.ratings.tsv.gz"
nameBasicsPath = "/partition/sparkscalabgc/src/main/resources/imdbdata/name.basics.tsv.gz"
titleBasicsPath = "/partition/sparkscalabgc/src/main/resources/imdbdata/title.basics.tsv.gz"
}
```

For running in cluster you can change masterurl value to sparkcluster or yarn
and keep same for running on local.

appName for passing application name to SparkSession.

File location can be updated in file section accordingly.

Code can run in cluster using command below

```
spark-submit --class "SparkScalaBcgMainApp" --master local[4] .target/scala-2.11/sparkscalabgc_2.11-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar path/application.conf
```
